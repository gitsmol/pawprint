## Measurement of symptoms
Symptoms are treated differently from the Bearable reports in the app. Pawprint uses the following rationale:

1. Two symptoms are objectively worse than one.
2. The severity of symptoms per day should be the average of all values given for that day.
3. The severity of all symptoms combined should be the sum of the per-symptom-averages.

### Example
<table class="tg">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="tg-0lax">Date</th>
        <th class="tg-0lax">Symptom</th>
        <th class="tg-0lax">Rating</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">1-1-2020</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Headache</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">1-1-2020</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Backpain</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2-1-2020</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Headache</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

</table>

In this example, we have averaged the symptoms per type. A graph showing the symptoms as a single value would then show their sum. This follows the assumption that 2 symptoms are worse than 1.
